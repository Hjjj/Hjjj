My first program was 'hello world' written in Basic on paper with a yellow pencil. 

## AI Model in Python

I'm currently working on a small AI model with all of the fundamental features of a modern Neural Network. 
The unique aspect of this project is that its built with NO PYTHON AI LIBRARIES. 
Why? Those libraries are a crutch - they do everything for you, so you cant learn the real AI algos if you use them. 
After this project I know the friggin' brains of 'ai' down to the last sigmoid activation. Uhh, that is, if I ever finish this project. 

The important features of such a system would be 
* No less than 3  transformation layers including the Input, Hidden, and Output layers.
* Neurons or Perceptrons with weighted inputs and a non-linear activation functions for output.
* Ability to run inference on the model
* Ability to train the model with data utilizing backpropagation to automatically tune the model.

## Falcon 9 Simulator

Also be sure to stop by my Falcon 9 Project. Its a real-world scale model of the F9 that moves at scale speed through a scale earth model in real time as it launches to orbit. Includes an orbiter and a booster that lands as per the real mission. 
Features code written in python to control all the servos and lights and screens. Includes full unit testing as well. 

You cant imagine the satisfaction of seeing the tiny booser lift off in realtime in perfect scale speed and distance. 

Enjoy!
